NOTICE: I do not guarantee ANYTHING with this package. If you use it you
        are doing so AT YOUR OWN RISK! I may or may not support this
        depending on my time schedule.

BENEFITS
    What is the deal with this?
    - This will tie an ini file into a hash so that you can easily update
      and edit the ini file by editing a simply hash.
    - You can create ini files or edit existing ini files.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
    What known problems does this thing have?
    - None thus far.


HOW TO INSTALL:
    - IF you are using the ActiveState version of Win32 Perl:
        a) Make a directory perl\lib\win32\tie\
        b) Copy the INI.PM file into the directory in step a
        c) Rename the file INI_XXX.PLL to INI.PLL
        d) Make a directory perl\lib\auto\win32\tie\ini\
        e) Copy the INI.PLL file into the directory in step d

    - IF you are using the core distribution of Win32 Perl:
        a) Make a directory perl\lib\site\win32\tie\
        b) Copy the INI.PM file into the directory in step a
        c) Rename the file INI_CORE.DLL to INI.DLL
        d) Make a directory perl\lib\site\auto\win32\tie\ini\
        e) Copy the INI.DLL file into the directory in step d

    That is it!



PARSE EXCEPTIONS:
    If you are lucky enough to get a parse exception when you use this
    extension then that means that the particular build of this extension is
    not compatible with your build of Win32 Perl. What you need to do is
    download a compatible build of the extension from our FTP site.
    The way you do this is first discovering your Win32 Perl build by using
    the following command:
        perl -v
    There will be a build number listed. Next download the updated version
    of this extension for that build number. You will need the one which
    either matches your build number or is the closest smaller build number.
    For example there are builds for 307 and 311. If you are using Win32 Perl
    build 313 you would download the extension built for 311 (since 311 and
    313 are compatible). However if you have Win32 Perl build 310 you would
    download the 307 build (builds 307 - 310 are all compatible).

    Crazy, eh? I am hoping that the builds will cease to change the way
    extensions are managed so we don't have this build breaking anymore. :)


GENERAL USE:
    When you want to modify an INI file you can tie the file to a hash
    like this:

      use Win32::Tie::Ini;

      tie( %File, "Win32::Tie::Ini", "c:/myfile.ini" ) || die "failed ($!).\n";

    That is it!
    Now you can access the values in in the INI file by means of the hash.
    Keep in mind that if you reference a section in the ini file then
    you are going to retrieve a hash reference to the keys of that section.
    What this means is that if your ini file looks like:
        [Section 1]
        key1=value1
        key2=value2

        [Section 2]
        key_a=value_a
        key_b=value_b

    Then to print [Section 1] key1 you would:
        print $File{'Section 1'}->{key1};

    If you want to change the value of [Section 2] key_b you would:
        $File{'Section 2'}->{key_b} = "My new value";

    If you want to get a list of all of the sections try:
        @Sections = keys( %File );

    And if you want a list of keys for section [Section 2] then try this:
        @Keys = keys( %{$File{'Section 2'}} );

        In this example keep in mind that the value returned by
        $File{'Section 2'} will be a hash reference. So to look at it as a
        hash you must force it's context into a hash:
            %{ $File{'Section 2'} }


    Once you are finished with the hash you need to:
        untie %File;
